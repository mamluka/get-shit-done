<objective>
Tombstone all execution-related commands, workflows, and agents with helpful redirect messages.

Purpose: WKFL-01 and WKFL-02 require that execute-phase, execute-plan, verify-phase, and verify-work commands no longer exist as functional workflows, and that gsd-executor and gsd-verifier agents are removed. Rather than deleting files (which would confuse users who try to invoke them), replace each with a tombstone message that explains what happened and redirects to the correct planning-only commands.

Output: 8 tombstoned files (2 commands, 4 workflows, 2 agents) plus updated quick command.

    Replace the content of each file with a tombstone redirect message. Keep the YAML frontmatter (name, description) but update description to "[REMOVED] This command/workflow has been removed". Remove all allowed-tools entries.

    For each COMMAND file (.claude/commands/gsd/*.md), use this structure:
    ```
    ---
    name: gsd:{command-name}
    description: "[REMOVED] Planning-only — this command has been removed"
    ---
    # Command Removed: /gsd:{command-name}

    This command was part of the execution workflow, which has been removed.

    **GSD is now planning-only.** Plans created with `/gsd:plan-phase` are implementation specifications for your engineering team, not executable instructions for Claude.

    ## What to do instead

    - **Plan a phase:** `/gsd:plan-phase {N}`
    - **Mark phase complete:** `/gsd:complete-phase {N}` (auto-advances to next phase)
    - **Revise planning artifacts:** `/gsd:edit-phase {N}`
    - **View available commands:** `/gsd:help`
    ```

    For each WORKFLOW file (.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/*.md), use the same tombstone pattern but without YAML frontmatter (workflows do not have frontmatter). Include a `<removed>` tag wrapper:
    ```
    <removed>
    # Workflow Removed: {workflow-name}

    This workflow was part of the execution/verification pipeline, which has been removed from the planning-only version of GSD.

    GSD is now a planning tool. Plans are specifications for engineering teams, not executable instructions.

    ## Replacement workflows
    - Planning: plan-phase.md
    - Phase completion: complete-phase.md (NEW - handles auto-advance)
    - Artifact editing: edit-phase.md (NEW)
    </removed>
    ```

    Be specific per file:
    - execute-phase.md: Mention it orchestrated parallel plan execution, now replaced by PM handoff
    - execute-plan.md: Mention it ran individual PLAN.md tasks, now replaced by PM handoff
    - verify-phase.md: Mention it verified goal achievement via code analysis, now replaced by PM review
    - verify-work.md: Mention it ran conversational UAT testing, now replaced by PM review
  </action>
  <verify>
    For each of the 6 files, confirm:
    1. File still exists (not deleted)
    2. Contains "removed" (case-insensitive)
    3. Contains at least one redirect to a valid command (/gsd:plan-phase or /gsd:complete-phase or /gsd:edit-phase)
    4. Does NOT contain any execution logic (no Task(), no subagent spawning, no INIT= lines)

    Run: `grep -l "removed\|REMOVED" .claude/commands/gsd/execute-phase.md .claude/commands/gsd/verify-work.md .claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md .claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan.md .claude/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-phase.md .claude/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md` should return all 6 files.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 6 execution command and workflow files contain tombstone redirects. No execution logic remains. Each file redirects users to appropriate planning-only commands.

    **Agent tombstones:** Replace content of gsd-executor.md and gsd-verifier.md with tombstone notices. Keep YAML frontmatter but update:
    - name: keep as-is (gsd-executor / gsd-verifier)
    - description: "[REMOVED] Planning-only — this agent has been removed"
    - tools: remove entirely
    - color: remove entirely

    Body should be:
    ```
    # Agent Removed: {agent-name}

    This agent was part of the execution/verification pipeline, which has been removed from the planning-only version of GSD.

    - **gsd-executor** ran PLAN.md tasks and created SUMMARY.md files
    - **gsd-verifier** verified phase goals were achieved in the codebase

    In the planning-only workflow, these responsibilities belong to the engineering team that receives the planning artifacts.

    ## Planning agents still active
    - `gsd-planner` — Creates PLAN.md files
    - `gsd-phase-researcher` — Researches domains for planning
    - `gsd-plan-checker` — Validates plan quality
    - `gsd-project-researcher` — Researches project domains
    ```

    **Quick command update:** Read .claude/commands/gsd/quick.md and .claude/get-shit-done/workflows/quick.md. Update both to:
    1. Remove references to "gsd-executor" — quick now only plans, it does not execute
    2. Remove "Spawns gsd-planner (quick mode) + gsd-executor(s)" — replace with "Spawns gsd-planner (quick mode)"
    3. Remove "Skips gsd-phase-researcher, gsd-plan-checker, gsd-verifier" — replace with "Skips gsd-phase-researcher, gsd-plan-checker"
    4. Update description to reflect planning-only: quick tasks produce plans, not executed code
    5. In the workflow file, remove any steps that spawn executor subagents or reference execution

    Note: Read each quick file first to understand its full structure before modifying.

    1. `grep -l "REMOVED\|removed" .claude/agents/gsd-executor.md .claude/agents/gsd-verifier.md` returns both files
    2. `grep -c "gsd-executor" .claude/commands/gsd/quick.md` returns 0 (no executor references remain)
    3. `grep -c "gsd-verifier" .claude/commands/gsd/quick.md` returns 0 (no verifier references remain)
    4. Agent files no longer contain `tools:` in frontmatter
