# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** PMs can go from idea to fully planned, phase-by-phase project specification using a conversational AI workflow — producing artifacts that are version-controlled, historically preserved, and ready for handoff to engineering.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Completed 01-02: Project management commands

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.13 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 8 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min), 01-02 (5min)
- Trend: Steady execution in phase 1

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Planning-only (no execution): PMs don't write code; execution adds complexity and confusion
- `.planning/{name}/v{N}/` folder structure: Preserves history of all projects and milestones in one repo
- `project/{name}` branch convention: Clean separation between projects, main stays clean
- Milestone = git tag: Lightweight, standard git practice, easy to reference
- Auto-advance phases: Reduces friction for PMs — no need to remember next command
- Jira MCP as optional prerequisite: PM teams likely use Jira; check availability without forcing it
- [Phase 01]: PathResolver uses zero external dependencies and synchronous operations for consistency
- [Phase 01]: Store active project in .planning/.active-project file for single source of truth
- [Phase 01]: Prompt user before activating newly created project to respect user control

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 Risks (from research):**
- HIGH: Breaking existing GSD installations if path refactoring incomplete
- MEDIUM: Data loss if migration script fails halfway
- MEDIUM: State corruption from concurrent operations without locking

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1: Git branch operations need project/version context from STATE.md
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1+2: Auto-advance logic reads STATE.md, needs git tagging from Phase 2
