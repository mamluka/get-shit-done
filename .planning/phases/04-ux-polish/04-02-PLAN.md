<objective>
Update all command descriptions and workflow files to use PM-friendly business language, and ensure execution command tombstones provide clear redirects to planning alternatives.

Purpose: PMs interacting with GSD commands should see descriptions, suggestions, and routing that use business concepts (plan, review, complete) rather than developer concepts (execute, branch, frontmatter). Removed execution commands should helpfully redirect to planning equivalents.

Output: Updated command .md files and workflow .md files with consistent business terminology and execution command redirects.

  <action>
**Note:** Phase 3 (WKFL-01) tombstones execution commands. This task ensures the tombstone message uses PM-friendly language per the Phase 4 UX Polish pattern from research.

Replace the contents of `commands/gsd/execute-phase.md` with a PM-friendly tombstone redirect. Follow the pattern from 04-RESEARCH.md Pattern 4:

```markdown
---
name: gsd:execute-phase
description: "[PLANNING TOOL] Plans are specifications for your team, not automated execution"
---

# This Is a Planning Tool

GSD helps you create detailed project plans. It does not execute code.

## What To Do Instead

The plans you create with GSD are specifications ready for your engineering team:

- **To plan a phase:** `/gsd:plan-phase {N}`
- **To review progress:** `/gsd:progress`
- **To discuss approach:** `/gsd:discuss-phase {N}`
- **To mark planning done:** `/gsd:complete-milestone`

## Why This Changed

GSD is now a planning-only tool. The plans you create (PLAN.md files) are detailed specifications that your engineering team can implement. This separation keeps planning focused and plans higher quality.

---

Run `/gsd:help` for all available commands.
```

This replaces the current execution-focused description with a clear, helpful redirect that explains GSD's planning-only nature without developer jargon.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `cat commands/gsd/execute-phase.md` shows planning-only message
2. `grep "plan-phase" commands/gsd/execute-phase.md` confirms redirect to planning command
3. No references to "execute", "run", or "deploy" as actions the tool performs
  </verify>
  <done>
execute-phase.md tombstone uses PM-friendly language with clear redirects to planning commands.

Update command descriptions and workflow files to replace developer terminology with business language. For each file, make targeted string replacements only in user-facing text (descriptions, display strings, help text). Do NOT change command names, file references, code blocks that call gsd-tools.js, or structural markdown.

**Command description updates (`commands/gsd/*.md`):**

1. **progress.md** (line 3):
   - Change description from: `"Check project progress, show context, and route to next action (execute or plan)"`
   - To: `"Check project progress, recent work, and what to do next"`

2. **verify-work.md** (line 17):
   - Change: `"Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution."`
   - To: `"Review completed work against success criteria. When issues are found, create fix plans for the engineering team."`
   - Line 19 — Change: `"If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for /gsd:execute-phase"`
   - To: `"If issues found: diagnosed gaps with fix plans ready for the team"`

3. **quick.md** (line 3):
   - Change description from: `"Execute a quick task with GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) but skip optional agents"`
   - To: `"Plan a quick task with state tracking, skipping optional agents"`

4. **new-project.md**: No terminology changes needed (already PM-friendly from Phase 1 updates). Confirm by reviewing — if any execution references remain, update them.

5. **switch-project.md**: No terminology changes needed (already PM-friendly from Phase 1 updates).

**Workflow routing updates (`get-shit-done/workflows/*.md`):**

1. **switch-project.md** (line 74):
   - Change: `"  /gsd:execute-phase {N} — execute planned phase"`
   - To: `"  /gsd:plan-phase {N} — plan next phase"`
   - (This appears in the "Next steps" section shown to users after switching projects)

2. **progress.md** — Multiple updates:
   - Route A section (~line 186): Change `"/gsd:execute-phase {phase}"` routing suggestion
   - To: `"/gsd:plan-phase {phase}"` (since plans are now specifications, not executable)
   - Route E section (~line 258): Change `"/gsd:execute-phase {phase} — execute phase plans"`
   - To: Remove this line entirely (execution is no longer available)
   - Success criteria (~line 382): Change `"Smart routing: /gsd:execute-phase if plans exist, /gsd:plan-phase if not"`
   - To: `"Smart routing to appropriate planning command"`

3. **new-project.md** — review for execution references:
   - Line 27-28 (auto_mode error): Change `"Error: --auto requires..."` to `"Problem: --auto requires..."` for consistency with the new error prefix
   - Workflow preferences section — The "Execution" question (line 320-326) about parallel vs sequential: This is about plan execution order, which is still relevant. Keep but rename header:
     - Change header from `"Execution"` to `"Plan Processing"`
     - Change question from `"Run plans in parallel?"` to `"Process plans in parallel?"`
   - The "Verifier" agent description (~line 348): Change `"After phase execution"` to `"After phase planning is complete"`

**Cross-reference validation:**
After all changes, verify:
- No workflow file references `/gsd:execute-phase` as an available command
- No command description says "execute" when describing what GSD does (exception: execute-phase.md tombstone explaining what changed)
- All "Next steps" sections point to planning commands (/gsd:plan-phase, /gsd:discuss-phase, /gsd:progress)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `grep -rn "execute-phase" commands/gsd/*.md` — only appears in execute-phase.md (tombstone)
2. `grep -rn "execute-phase" get-shit-done/workflows/switch-project.md` — zero matches
3. `grep -rn "execute-phase" get-shit-done/workflows/progress.md` — zero matches (removed from routing)
4. `grep -n "plan-phase" get-shit-done/workflows/switch-project.md` — confirms planning command in next steps
5. `grep -n "planning-only\|plan-phase\|planning tool" commands/gsd/execute-phase.md` — confirms redirect language
  </verify>
  <done>
All command descriptions and workflow files use business language. No workflow routes to execution commands. execute-phase.md has clear planning-only redirect. All "Next steps" sections point to planning commands.
  </done>
</task>

1. `grep -rn "execute-phase" commands/gsd/ get-shit-done/workflows/` — only appears in execute-phase.md tombstone and execute-phase.md workflow (which Phase 3 will remove)
2. `grep -rn "/gsd:execute" get-shit-done/workflows/switch-project.md get-shit-done/workflows/progress.md` — zero matches
3. Command descriptions avoid developer jargon — no "frontmatter," "YAML," "git branch" in description lines
4. execute-phase.md contains clear redirect to /gsd:plan-phase
5. progress.md routes to planning commands, not execution commands
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- execute-phase.md tombstone uses PM-friendly language with clear alternatives
- All workflow "Next steps" sections reference planning commands only
- Command descriptions use business language (plan, review, check instead of execute, parse, validate)
- No workflow routes users to removed execution commands
- Cross-reference validation confirms no broken command references
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-ux-polish/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
