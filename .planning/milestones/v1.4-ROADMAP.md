# Roadmap: GSD for PMs - v1.4 Jira Sync

## Overview

Transform planning artifacts (requirements and phases) into actionable Jira tickets under a milestone epic, with Notion page links for stakeholder collaboration, team assignment, and create+update semantics. Enables PMs to push specs from git into team workflow tools with full traceability.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (17, 18, 19, 20, 21): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (e.g., 17.1, 17.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

### Phase 17: Jira MCP Detection & Prerequisites
**Goal**: Validate environment and collect configuration required for Jira sync operations
**Depends on**: Phase 16 (v1.3 complete)
**Requirements**: SETUP-01, SETUP-02, SETUP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees clear install command if Jira MCP is not available
  2. User is blocked with actionable message if notion-sync.json doesn't exist (with guidance to run sync-notion first)
  3. User can view and select target Jira project from available projects
  4. Selected Jira project ID is saved for the sync operation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 17-01-PLAN.md

### Phase 18: Granularity Strategy & Ticket Mapping
**Goal**: Enable flexible ticket creation at phase, category, or requirement level based on team workflow preferences
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: GRAN-01, GRAN-02, GRAN-03, GRAN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User is prompted to choose ticket granularity (phase-level, category-level, requirement-level) at start of each sync
  2. Phase-level creates one ticket per phase with all requirements listed in description
  3. Category-level creates one ticket per requirement category with individual requirements as checklist items
  4. Requirement-level creates one ticket per REQ-ID with phase context included in description
  5. Ticket structure matches user's selected granularity choice without manual configuration
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 18-01-PLAN.md

### Phase 19: Epic & Ticket Creation
**Goal**: Push planning artifacts to Jira as structured epic and tickets with Notion links and preview workflow
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: TICK-01, TICK-02, TICK-03, TICK-04, TICK-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Epic is created per milestone as parent for all tickets
  2. Tickets are created as children of the epic
  3. Each ticket includes Notion page link as remote link (pulled from notion-sync.json)
  4. Ticket descriptions include relevant planning content (requirements, success criteria, phase context)
  5. User sees full ticket preview (epic + all tickets) before any writes to Jira
  6. User can approve or cancel the sync operation after preview
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 19-01-PLAN.md

### Phase 20: Team Assignment
**Goal**: Enable epic and ticket assignment to team members for workload distribution
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: TEAM-01, TEAM-02, TEAM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees list of Jira project team members with names and account IDs
  2. User can assign epic to self or a team member
  3. User can assign tickets to team members (bulk assignment or individual per ticket)
  4. Assignments are reflected in Jira after sync completes
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 20-01-PLAN.md

### Phase 21: Update Semantics & Tracking
**Goal**: Enable incremental sync with create vs update detection and local tracking
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: SYNC-01, SYNC-02, SYNC-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Ticket-to-Jira mapping is persisted in .planning/jira-sync.json per project
  2. Re-running sync updates existing tickets instead of creating duplicates
  3. New requirements or phases detected on re-run create new tickets
  4. jira-sync.json tracks ticket IDs with granularity metadata (phase/category/requirement)
  5. Update operations preserve existing ticket IDs and links
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 21-01-PLAN.md

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21
