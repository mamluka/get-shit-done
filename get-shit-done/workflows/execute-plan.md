# Workflow Removed: execute-plan

This workflow was part of the execution/verification pipeline, which has been removed from the planning-only version of GSD.

**What it did:** Executed individual PLAN.md tasks atomically, handled TDD cycles, applied deviation rules, managed checkpoints, created SUMMARY.md files, and committed work incrementally.

GSD is now a planning tool. Plans are specifications for engineering teams, not executable instructions.

## Replacement workflows
- Planning: plan-phase.md
- Phase completion: complete-phase.md (NEW - handles auto-advance)
- Artifact editing: edit-phase.md (NEW)
</removed>
