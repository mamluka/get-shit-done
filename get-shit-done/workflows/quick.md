# Workflow Removed: quick

This workflow was part of the execution/verification pipeline, which has been removed from the planning-only version of GSD.

**What it did:** Executed small, ad-hoc tasks by spawning gsd-planner (quick mode) and gsd-executor, tracking tasks in `.planning/quick/`, and updating STATE.md.

GSD is now a planning tool. Plans are specifications for engineering teams, not executable instructions.

## Replacement workflows
- Planning: plan-phase.md
- Phase completion: complete-phase.md (NEW - handles auto-advance)
- Artifact editing: edit-phase.md (NEW)
</removed>
