# Command Removed: /gsd:execute-phase

This command was part of the execution workflow, which has been removed.

**GSD is now planning-only.** Plans created with `/gsd:plan-phase` are implementation specifications for your engineering team, not executable instructions for Claude.

## What to do instead

- **Plan a phase:** `/gsd:plan-phase {N}`
- **Mark phase complete:** `/gsd:complete-phase {N}` (auto-advances to next phase)
- **Revise planning artifacts:** `/gsd:edit-phase {N}`
- **View available commands:** `/gsd:help`
