# This Is a Planning Tool

GSD helps you create detailed project plans. It does not execute code.

## What To Do Instead

The plans you create with GSD are specifications ready for your engineering team:

- **To plan a phase:** `/gsd:plan-phase {N}`
- **To review progress:** `/gsd:progress`
- **To discuss approach:** `/gsd:discuss-phase {N}`
- **To mark planning done:** `/gsd:complete-milestone`

## Why This Changed

GSD is now a planning-only tool. The plans you create (PLAN.md files) are detailed specifications that your engineering team can implement. This separation keeps planning focused and plans higher quality.

Run `/gsd:help` for all available commands.
