# Workflow Removed: verify-phase

This workflow was part of the execution/verification pipeline, which has been removed from the planning-only version of GSD.

**What it did:** Verified phase goal achievement via code analysis, checked must-haves against actual codebase, identified gaps between tasks completed and goals achieved, and created VERIFICATION.md reports.

GSD is now a planning tool. Plans are specifications for engineering teams, not executable instructions. PM reviews now replace automated verification.

## Replacement workflows
- Planning: plan-phase.md
- Phase completion: complete-phase.md (NEW - handles manual verification)
- Artifact editing: edit-phase.md (NEW)
</removed>
