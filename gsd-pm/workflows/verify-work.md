# Workflow Removed: verify-work

This workflow was part of the execution/verification pipeline, which has been removed from the planning-only version of GSD.

**What it did:** Ran conversational UAT testing, presented tests one at a time to users, collected feedback, diagnosed issues via parallel debug agents, and automatically planned gap closure fixes.

GSD is now a planning tool. Plans are specifications for engineering teams, not executable instructions. PM reviews now replace automated UAT.

## Replacement workflows
- Planning: plan-phase.md
- Phase completion: complete-phase.md (NEW - handles manual verification)
- Artifact editing: edit-phase.md (NEW)
</removed>
